# TR-12 Client Integration Architecture

A device integrator building TR-12 support needs to implement three components on the device alongside the CDD SDK process: a **TR-12 Shim** that bridges the device's native control plane to TR-12 models, a **Native Device Control API** that the shim drives, and a **Web Console** that gives the device user visibility into both the TR-12 connection state and the underlying device settings.

## Integration Requirements

1. **User-facing controls** — The Web Console must let the device user enable/disable TR-12, select a host service, view the pairing code, and see the current connection state (DISCONNECTED, PAIRING, CONNECTED, RECONNECTING).

2. **Separation of concerns** — The Web Console handles user input and display only. The TR-12 Shim running on the device is responsible for driving the CDD SDK (connect, disconnect, report status, apply configuration) and translating between TR-12 models and the native device control API. The console never talks to the SDK directly.

3. **Persistent connections** — The shim must persist the user-selected TR-12 host ID across reboots and software updates. On power-up, the shim should automatically call `connect` with the previously configured `hostId` and `registration` payload. Users expect a paired and connected device to reconnect without manual intervention after a restart.

4. **Configuration refresh** — When the host service pushes a new desired configuration via MQTT, the shim applies it to the native device API and the console must refresh its display to reflect the updated state. The device user should always see the complete, current configuration without manually reloading.  The Web Console likely must call an API hosted by the Shim to see when an refresh is needed.

5. **Status reporting** — The shim must periodically read back actual device state from the native control API (bitrate, temperature, channel state, etc.) and publish it to the host service via `report_status`. The reporting interval is governed by the host settings received during authentication.

6. **Actual configuration reporting** — After applying a desired configuration, the shim must read back what the device actually applied and report it via `report_actual_configuration`. This lets the host service detect discrepancies between desired and actual state.

7. **Pairing flow visibility** — During initial pairing, the console must display the pairing code and expiration countdown so the user can claim the device on the host service. The shim polls `connect` until the device transitions from PAIRING to CONNECTED.  

8. **Deprovision support** — The console must provide a way for the user to deprovision the device from a host service, which deletes local credentials and informs the host. The shim calls `deprovision` on the SDK and resets to DISCONNECTED.

The diagram below shows how these pieces interact.

## DeviceCallbacks Interface

The shim is implemented by providing a `DeviceCallbacks` interface. This is the only code a device integrator needs to write — the `ApplicationLoop` and `Tr12Shim` are reusable and device-agnostic.

```go
type DeviceCallbacks interface {
    // Apply (set) side — called when applying desired configuration from the host
    UpdateDeviceKeyValue(key, value string)
    UpdateChannelSettings(channelID, key, value string)
    UpdateChannelProfile(channelID, profileID string)
    UpdateChannelConnection(channelID string, connection *cddsdkgo.Connection)
    UpdateChannelState(channelID string, state cddsdkgo.ChannelState)

    // Read-back (get) side — called when building actual configuration to report back
    GetDeviceUpdatedValue(key string) (string, bool)
    GetChannelUpdatedValue(channelID, key string) (string, bool)
    GetChannelProfileValue(channelID string) (string, bool)
    GetChannelConnection(channelID string) *cddsdkgo.Connection
    GetChannelState(channelID string) cddsdkgo.ChannelState
    GetDeviceStatus() []cddsdkgo.StatusValue
    GetChannelStatus(channelID string) []cddsdkgo.StatusValue
}
```

The `Tr12Shim` walks the TR-12 model structures and dispatches to these callbacks in a defined order per channel: settings → connection → state (last). This ordering ensures all settings and transport configuration are applied before the channel state is set.

## Channel State Management and Restart Behavior

Many devices require a channel restart for new settings to take effect. The `UpdateChannelState` callback is responsible for managing this correctly.

### Example Channel State Machine

A typical device has four channel states with strict transitions:

```
stopped  →  [start]  →  starting  →  started
started  →  [stop]   →  stopping  →  stopped
```

Where transitional states have only one possible next state:
- `stopping` can only transition to `stopped`
- `starting` can only transition to `started`

### Restart Logic

When `UpdateChannelState(ACTIVE)` is called, the implementation must handle all possible current states — including transitional ones — to reliably reach the desired state. A typical approach:

| Current state | Action |
|---|---|
| `stopped` | Start immediately |
| `stopping` | Wait for `stopped`, then start |
| `started` | Stop, wait for `stopped`, then start (settings restart) |
| `starting` | Wait for `started`, stop, wait for `stopped`, then start |

Making `UpdateChannelState` fully synchronous — blocking until the device reaches the desired state — ensures that when `GetActualConfiguration` is called immediately after, the reported channel state is accurate.

### Why Restart is Always Performed When Already Running

The `ApplicationLoop` gates configuration updates on `updateId` — `ApplyDesiredConfiguration` is only called when the host sends a genuinely new configuration. Since individual setting changes are not tracked, a restart is always performed when the channel is running and a new config arrives. This is correct behavior: the host only increments `updateId` when something actually changed.

### Reporting Channel State During Transitions

`GetChannelState` should map device-native status to TR-12 state conservatively — only return `IDLE` when the channel is fully stopped. Transitional states (`stopping`, `starting`) should be reported as `ACTIVE` because the channel is either mid-restart (will be running shortly) or shutting down as part of a restart sequence.

| Device status | TR-12 state |
|---|---|
| `stopped` | `IDLE` |
| `stopping`, `starting`, `started` | `ACTIVE` |
